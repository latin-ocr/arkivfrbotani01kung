In some of my specimens there. is a slight differ-enee as
to the number of venules3 these are very crowded in a spe-
cimen from French Guiana, fig. 31, Α (collected by Sagot);
less crowded in specimens from Cuba, fig. 31, C (Wright,
n. 952 ex parte3 the *rest is Tr. lineolatum, see below!), and
rather sparse in my Brazilian specimens, fig. 31, B.

Tonfflmctatmn is generally a very minute plant, the roundish
(orbicular or reniform) fronds being only 4—ss mm in length
(the involucres included). The frond is only slightly waved
or lobed at the margin, but more often cut into minute roun-
dish teeth or lobules. The margin has larger and more nu-
merous hairs, than in Tr. splcenoides. In this respect, as
well as on account of its very large invomere, this species
comes nearer to Tr. pusillum.

Ι collected T rich. punctatmn (a form with rather sparse
venation) in Brazil, Matto-Grosso, on trees in the primeval
forest called »Poaia», 13th April 1894, Exped. 1. Regnell.,

In connection with Tr. punctatum I mention briefly the
very imperfectly known Tr. lineolatmn (V. D. B.) Hook. No
illustration exists of this species, except Fee's »Didym lacera-
tuom (1866), quoted above, which seems to‘ answer perfectly
to lineolatum. This species 13 very different from the others
of Didymoglossum, and its peculial-ities are very well ex-

plained by Van den Bosch in the original description: »- —— fir-
miuscule rigida -ω — costa a basi inde in venas simplices
furcata-sve flabellatas valde approximatas soluta — —».

According to these marks, I think 1 am correct in re-
ferring Wright⁷s plant from Cuba, n. 952, to Tr. liweolatum
(a portion of his collection n. 952 is Tr. punctatum, see above),
