48 ARKIV FOR BOTANIK. BAND 1.

The veins are arranged in the same manner as in Tr.
maenades, the costa being sometimes branohed into a few
thieker veins‚ one for each lobe; yet, owing to its narrow
shape‚ in most fronds it is quite alone like a branchless
midrib, and all other veinlets are equal, slender‚ repeatedly
branched, and more or less flexuose or arcuate. The ulti-
mate venales are separated at the margin by 4—8 rows of
cells.

The cellular structure does not seem different from the
preceding species of the sphenoides-group3 fig. 25, D, E.

On this plant I have found no fronds of roundish outline
and subfiabellate venation, as in the two preceding species
(and in the two following also).

The involucre is immersed to the lips. The marginal
hairs are shorter and finer than in Tr. spleenoides.

The plant, which I now distinguish by this name, is of
the same external appearance as Tr. splzenoides, except as to
venation, for its venules are much more crowded than Ihave
found to be the case in any other species of Didymoylossum:
Near to the margin the venules are so numerous and close
together, that it is difficult in some cases to draw them se-
parate, if enlarged 20 times, even with a very fine pencil-
point. In this respect there seems to be no variation if full-
grown, fertile or sterile, fronds are regarded. The veinlets
are 1110511)Υ all similar3 no thicker veins except the midrib.

Like Tr. sphenoide& this produces sterile fronds of orbi-
cular form and subflabellate venation, fig. 28, Β, and fertile
fronds of slightly larger size. The feitile blade is broale
oblong‚ ox ate or obovate, with a short apical lobe, bearing a
single involucre, fig. 28, A, and 29. The base varies, as in
other species, from& cordate to truncate ovate, or broadlx
cuneate.
