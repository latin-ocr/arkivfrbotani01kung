30 Amm* FOR BorANIK. ΒΑΜ) 1.

The speeies in question belongs to the group I am now
dealing with, because the involucro is quite exserted, distinotly
twolipped, and placed at the apex of some termina] lobe (»sori
primitus terminales», Van den Bosoh; »epitaeti Sori»‚ Prantl).
The eutting is somewhat like that of Tr. Krausse'z· (p. 26),
but is (leeper pinnatifid down to a narrowly winged rachis:
in general the same frond is partially bipinnatifid. All seg-
ments are patent3 the ultimate ones are linear and very nar-
row, as in' Tr. sociale (p. 17), and never entire, but deeply
and elegantly crenate or moniliform, as said above. The se-
oondary and tertiary veins are all decidedly flexuose, running
almost at right angles from their main costa.

This is one of the first species described os this whole
group (1788). From the original spec-iniens in Herb. Swartz
it is evident, that Tr. reptans belongs to a type different from
the old Tr. lcymenoides, and to the same type as Tr. Kraussiz',
quercifoliuem, φηθῐαηοριιε, and others. It has an elongated
frond of distinctly pinnatifid cutting, and pinnate veins from
a long eentral (fosta, even in a sterile frond, and should by
no means be consounded with Tr. sphenoides Kze, nor placed
with Tr. punctatum Poir„ as is (lone in the great English
works quoted above. In general outline, this species eomes
