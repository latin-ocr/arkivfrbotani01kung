LINDMAN, AMERICAN SPECIES OF TRICHOMANES SM. 51

(fig. 26) does to the West Indian and Guianian Tr. sphe—
noides (fig. 22, 23).

The eolour of adult fronds is green, in the Brazilian
specimens (gathered in September at Rio de Janeiro) dark
green. Marginal hairs are neither very long nor numerous,
and in adult fronds have often fallen off altogether. — The
involucra is rather small, the lips about Ost» mm long, and
O‚⁷ mm broad.

The cells are in most cases rather large, fig. 25, F. H,
but are shorter than in Tr. pusillum and nearly square3 the
are arranged in regular rows, 2-4 in the interspaces of the
veinlets. The walls are very thin, like those of Tr. sphe-
noides. The involucra] lips, Which I have examined micro-
scopieally, have a margin of relatively small and short cells,
fig. 25, G, I. —

Ι have founded this speeies on specimens, gathered in
oFrench Guiana by Sagot in 1⁸58 (n. 847, ex parte) and 1859,
some of them found intermixed in a tuft of Tr. Kraussiz‘, the
others together with T ν. sphenoides. and in the latter ease
impossible to separate without a good magnifying-glass, which
,had to be employed for every frond of the two entangled
plah‘ts. Intermediate forms — as to the venation —— were
not found. m Ι further observed the same plant (or a proper
closely-allied specieSP) in Herb. Regnell in Stockholm‚ ga-
thered on trees on Coroovado mountain at Rio de J aneiro by
Mosen, n. 271911‘2, 20th September 1874.

A plant, which is at once clearly characterized by its
size, habit, and venation, and well described by Hooker and
Greville, who ought to be called the authors of the species·
