LINDMAN, AMERICAN spsscms or TRICHOMANES SM. 29

The fernherbarium in Stoekholm possesses numerous in-
dividuals of this speeies. Without a magnifying—glass it
would be very diffioult to distinguish this plant from Tr.
Kraussii, but when slightly magnifieri, it offers at 0116611115111)Γ
peculiarities and a very striking appearance. As the origi-
nal description (Baker, Syn. Fil„ ed. 2, p. 465) 15 rather
short, and the plant, which is only known from Spruoe⁷s ‹fol-
leetion (n. 5354), was earlier eonfounded with Tr. Krauss‘iz', Ι
think an illustration and a fuller description are desirable.

The rhizome is exeeedingly stout and densely tomentose.
The short stipes is also tomentose below, the upper half
(1 em) naked and flattened. The frond is rigid and as dry

corrugated altogether, but somewhat shining, yellowish or
nearly reddish3 the length is 2-5,1116 width 1,.-‚—2,5 cm. The
primary segments are almost horizontal and some of them
considerably lengthened, simple, or pinnatifid again3 the nar-
rower segments and all ultimate ones are ‹lensely erenate or
Α moniliforni. The venation is quite peculiar: the midrib stout
and rather straight, secondary veins very flexuose, all ulti-
mate venules very short, rising at a nearly right angle and
then ineurved to the margin3 spurious veinlets very few and
short. Marginal hairs very long. The 66115 are middle-sized,
about 0‚050—O,0:.a mm long3 the walls only O,oo4—O‚0oc mm
thick, fig. 15, B.
