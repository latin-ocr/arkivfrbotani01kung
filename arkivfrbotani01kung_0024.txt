Among-st the small Trichoinanes this is probably only
recognized by its few and distant veins. The central costa
is relatively thick3 the secondary veins run out at short
distances from each other from the base of the costa, forming
about half a right angle to the costa, each of them going to
a main lohe and reaching a considerable length, but forked

only in 3 few brancheS. The spurious veinlets are only seen ,

near the apex of 3 lobe and are few. short and interrupted.

The shape of the frond is generally recognized at once,
but not in all cases. The common form is broadly rounded
with a few very dilated lobes, fig. 13 this is brilliantly
represented by the illustration of »Tam amodum» Hook. et Grev„
Ic. Fil.. t. 1173 and most characteristic are the prolonged,
thickly tomentose caudex (ihizome) and the renisorm, slightly
