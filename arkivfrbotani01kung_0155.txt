has not quite grasped the impert of my theory. Ι feel obli-
ged to elucidate the matter in some few words.

If we try to make clear to ourselves the origin of the
outbreak of a uredo-pustule fleck of an heteroecious species
of rust (e. g. I’etccim'a ιᾳναυιίητίε), we have to suppose several
different possibilities. The fleck can arise 1) from an infe c-
tion by uredospores (e. g. {fredo yramine's‘) or 2) from an
infection by accidiospores (e. g. Aecz‘dinm Boo-bericus).
Numerous experiments have fully proved that both of these
modes of origin occur. The time that elapses between the
infection by spores and the outbreak of pustules, or the period
of incubation, as it is called, is comparatively short, ψ being
from about 8 to 10 days.

The present position of the rust-question is, however,
such that we can no longer be satisfied with these two¹
modes of origin. Willingly or unwillingly we are obliged
to suppose two further possibilities. It is possible that an
uredo—pustule fleck can also arise 3) from a direct infection
by teleutospores (e. g. Puccim'a yrmnims) without the
intervention of an aecidium-stage, or 4) from a latent germ
of disease inherited from the parent plant, concealed
in the seed sown or, as far as concerns a perennia] grass,
in the stolon growing forth in the spring. Both these modes
of origin presuppose a long period of incubation, varying
from about 2 to 10 months.²

Although many reasons speak for a direct infection by
teleutospores,3 it must however be confessed that this question
is still far from being solved:1

On the other hand there seems to me to be a sufficient
number of proofs which point to the mode of origin last
mentioned — a latent germ of disease, inherited from the
