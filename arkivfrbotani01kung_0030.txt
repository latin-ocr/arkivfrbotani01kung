111 diameter, fig. 6.

The shape of ‘ohe lobes and their venationis more varied,
and Tr. sociale eonstitutes a more eompound form than Tr.
leymenoideae the lobes are very often quite linear and more
large than broad, giving room for more numerous ultimate
veinlets in 0 10110, than in any form of Tr. hymenoides. Each
10110 has a long, flexuose, regularly 11111110Ἑο midrib with
alternating veinlet-S.

There may be a greaber differenee‚ if ‘che rhizome, as is
the ease with our specimens‚ is more 01011ᾶο1ἱ and less shaggy
than in T r. hymenoides, but this 0011 only be decided by

¹ In a specimen from Herb. Swartz‚ fig. 6, A. Tr. hymenoz'des has the
two lips of the iux-oluere reddish brown: in a South Brazilian one, fig. 6, Β,
the 1111 is bordered with a whitish edge. These differences probably depend
