36 ARKIV FoR BOTANIK. BAND 1·

The cellular structure of Tr. pusillum is regularly reti-
culated, owing to the very crowded parallel venules, like Tr.
reptans, but in this case the walls are much thinner than in
all the preceding plants, being only 0,002—0,003 mm thick3
fig. 20, B, C, 21, B, O.

The involucre isldistinctly winged by the apex of 510115,
and thus more or less sunk in the frond, although in old sam-
ples it may appear free through the bursting of the fragile
wing. (Swartz therefore says in his original description:
<urceoli exserti», Syn. Fil., 1806, p. 142). The involucral lips
seem to be a little larger than in Tr. splzeowides and its allies
(5. below). ——

The true Tr. pusillum Herb. Swartz‚ which is a very
peculiar species of Didymoglossum, is probably not known
with certainty to live in any other countries than the West
Indies, Jamaica, Swartz, Nevertheless Ι suppose, that Fee’s
Didymoylossum anqustifrons, Fil. Antill., t. 28, f. 5, belongs
here, but I am not sure.

Ι have had the opportunity in the Herb. Stockholm of
exainining several forms of Didymoglossum, which aH come
very near to the preceding (Tr. pusillum), with respect to
the combined marks of very small size, few and short lobes
or almost entire fronds‚ and very fine and numerous venules,
filling the whole area of the frond. They belong to that
little group, which in Hook. and Bak. Synopsis, ed. 2, p. 74,
