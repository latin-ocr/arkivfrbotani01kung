synonym for Trich. punctatum Poir.; the »pusillmn Sw.» is taken
in the same sense as by Hooker and Baker, which I think
is a 1111515116, which has for a long time kept the commonest
South American species and forms of this genus in confusion.

In the list of names by R. SADEBECK in Engler und
Prantl, Die naturlichen Pflanzenfamilien, Τ6111, Abteil. 4,
1899, p. 104, the confusion of the old species is not improved,
the names reptans, pusillum and quercifolium being still
used in the same sense as by Hooker and Baker, several
polymorphous species (as muscoides Suu, quercifolium and
Kraussii Hook. et Grev.) being left without sufficient points
of identification or proper bounds.

As these plants doubtless are still difficult to distinguish.
Ι think it would be useful for collectors to have some short
notes about the commonest species, with exact illustrations,
showing the shape. size, veins, and cellular structure on the
same enlarged scale. lt 15 evident, that in cellular plants, 50
like the 11105565 55 111656, we 0511 not dispense with microsco-
pical inspection‚ and our knowledge of such species will be
very vague, or even incorrect, with only 5 macroscopical
view. In fact, not only 1155 the microscope proved, that
there are differences in the shape and size of the cells, which
deserve special attention, as already stated by several au-
thors,¹ but a certain enlargement is also absolutely necessary.
if the veins are to be clearly 56611 and illustrated.

Through the neglect of this rule, 50 many recent descrip-
tions of new species of D‘z'dymoylossmn are made useless.
There are South American species recently described by G.
S. Jenman, for instance setiferum (Baker‘), labiniam, fruticu-
losum, Fraseri, and others, bnt without seeing the original
specimens, it is quite impossible to understand their relation
to known species, or to apply such a name to aplant ga-
thered in other places in the future. I do not doubt that the
author has described these plants accurately from living spe-
cimens, but in most cases, where exact marks are wanted for
the purpose of identifying a species without any hesitation?
