to the pressing need of modern histological methods in the field
of phytopathological research. By the fuller paper which
we arc promised, we may expect that one of the gaps which
at present exist in our knowledge of the life-history of the
fungus — the period of the fungeous life as mycelium in the
tissues of the host plant — will be as fully filled as the
present stand-point of histological technics will permit.

I cannot conclude these remarks without attracting atten-
tion to perhaps an unimportant question regarding a name
which has awakened my surprise. MARSHALL WARD terms
the fungus with which he is occupied Puceinia dispersa
(ER11{S.). It is true that the species of fungus to Which
MARSHALL WARD’s form belongs, was described in the year
1894 under the name of Puccmia dispersa ERIKS. Sc HENN.‚¹
but it should also be observed that some years later (189952
that collective species was broken up into no less than 6
different species. Since that date the name Panaima dis-
persa ERIKS. significs only the brown rust which is found on
rye, while, on the other hand, the fungus on the Bromes ought
correctly to be. termed Pnacium momina Emus.
