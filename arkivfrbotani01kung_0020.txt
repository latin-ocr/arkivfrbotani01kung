Icones Filicum (1829). ·

By the aid of the above mentioned original specimens it
was evident, that not the authentic plantS, described as the
first species of this group in Swartz's Prodromus, and Sy-
nopsis Filicum, viz. ozzuscoo‘de.s and reptans, but rather diffe-
rent ones have been adopted by the distinguished english
botanists‚ and in consequence of this, many other small. Tri-
chomanes are named and limited incorrectly. After looking
through a good many Central and South American samples
and classing them as their characters required, I found my-
self obliged to give up the arrangement given in Hooker’s
and Baker's Synopsis, and only after classifying all the
species according to the original specimens met within Herb.
SwartZ, 1 was able to explain the meaning of some doubtful
drawings in the excellent work of Hooker and Greville, such
as their apodum, muscoideffi reptans, qnercifolium etc.

My objections, however, were not fresh ones, for I found
very soon, that PRESL had observed the erroneous conception.
of Hooker and Greville concerning »munscoides:> and :neptam-5>
(Hook. et Grexn, Ic. Fil„ t. 179 and 32). Presl calls the
former Trichomancs Ηοοῖεθνί1 and the latter Dadymoylossmw
Hooloeri? He refers to the Tr. wmscoides Sw. (non Hook. et
Grev.) as a mere synonym the aposlum» Hook. et Grev„ Ic.
Fil.‚ t. 117.

Then we find that Kusz in 1847, only a year after the
publication of the first volume of Hooker's Species Filicum,
pronounced the Same opinion 3 and proved, from original speci-
mens of Swartz, to be seen 111 Herb. Willdenow, that »museoi-
des» and :.›o*e])†(c›zs.› in Hooker's Spec. Fil. are not the true
species of Swartz. (He also states4, that »querezjfolimm Hook.
et Grev„ Ic. Fil., t. 115, is no doubt a large, deeply pinua-
tifid form of Tr. reptans Herb. Swart23 but in this opinion
Kunze is no doubt mistaken.)

We find the same opinion advanced by K. MULLERJ') who
exactly describes both the old Tr. muscoides Sw. and the
