noides Kze (the latter called »reptans», not reptans Sw.; see
above p. 30).

Among these it is pretty easy to distinguish Tr. puncta-
tum by its venules of different thickness, which are for the
most part distinctly thieker towards the point. This species
will be mentioned below, at the end of this paper (fig. 30, 31).

The rest of this small species at first appeared rather
easy to classify, and although they are of different outline, Ι

put them together as Tr. sphenoides Kze. But after examin· ·

ing them microscopically, Ι got into⁴ difficulties, because I
saw that besides their being of slightly different size, shape,
colour, etc, they include somewhat dissimilar types of vena.-
tion, and on> account of this (lifference‚ Ι cannot unite them
as 0116 single species, according to the importance which we
must ascribe to the venation as a distinguishing mark for
species of ferns.

Ι had first to decide, therefore, which of the forms be-
fore me Ι could identify with the old species Tr. splcenoides
Kunze (1834), beautifully illustrated by G. Kunze, Die Farrn-
krauter, T. 88, F. 2, but many times mistaken, or rejected
altogether by pteridologists. As Kunze has himself quoted
»Trich reptans Hook. et Grev„ t. 32» (not reptans Sw.!), Which
is an excellent drawing, Ι have this to go by also, and guid-
ed by these illustrations, I think Ι have before me several
specimens‚ which Ι may give, with good reason, as the true
sphenoides; see my drawings, fig. 22 and 23.

In this genuine sphenoides the venules are not very crowd-
ed, and especially much sparser thau in Tr. pusillum Sw.
(fig. 21) and in my Tr. myrionemvn (fig. 28, 29). There are .
in the larger fronds a few stronger veins, like the midrib
(see also Tr. pusillum, fig. 21), each of them going to a lobe
and no doubt equivalent to those, which in Tr. Jzymenoidesa
fig. 1, and its allies‚ form the midrib of each primary seg-
ment (Prantl’s »wahre Nervem or genuine veins); but the rest
of the veins are very slender and all equaL both the longer
branches and the short intel-rupted &spurious->0 veinlets. They
are separated from each other by several (ci—5 or more) rows
of rather broad and open cells, fig. 24, 25 A, B. Only sterile
fronds can be called »flabellate.> (or subfiabellate) in a certain
stage as to the venation, because they occur without any
distinct midrib in the upper half, see fig. 28, C.
