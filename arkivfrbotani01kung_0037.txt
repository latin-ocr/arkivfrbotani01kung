drawings were not quoted.

After many researches among accessible specimens -— in
many cases of all the fronds of a specimen ——‚ I am now
convinced‚ there is a South and Centra] American plant, which
must be referred to Tr. Kraussiz· Hook. et GreV„ as a proper
speeieS, and this can always be distinguished by certain cha-
racteristics, Which are to he searched for in every tuft, though
they ‹·ann0t be recognized
on every frond of a speci-
men. Only in its extreme
forins, and when in suli con-
formity with the original
drawing in Hook. et GreV.‚
t. 149, can a plant be clas-
sified without hesitation as
T1·.Kraussii. Ι believe that.
when inspecting a large co]-
lection of specimens, san]-
ples will always be met
with, which seem to ap-
proach in exter-nal habit to
Tr. querclfolizcm (as I have Ι
made out it above). As the ’
specific marks are rather ε
diffieult for an untrained
eye, they will be under-
stood best by comparing ..
