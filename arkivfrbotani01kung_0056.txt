really different forms, than endeavour to force them into a
few unskilfully characterized and dubious species. For the
purpose of gaining a scrupulous knowledge of these minute ’
plants, it must be repeated, that only a microscopical exami-
nation can afford a useful result.

I have seen Tr. sphenoides (as it is limited here) from
Guadaloupe, collected by F orsstrom (Herb. Casstrom, Stock-
holm), fig. 22, A-C, and from French Guiana, collected by
Sagot, n. 847 (ex parte3 the rest of 847 is my Trich. myrio-
neuron), fig. 23, A, B and 28, C. Probably belongs here a
specimen from Cuba, collected by Wright, n. 1836 (and n. 915,
ex parte), fig. 23, CssE. I collected this species in the Bra-
zilian state of Matto-Grosso, on trees amongst mosses in the
primeva] forest called ³>Poaia÷> (and intermixed with Tr. punc—
tatum), Exped. 1. Regnell., n. 29031s23 fig. 22, D—F.

Τ1115 plant, which I collected in South Brazil, is a very
minute fern, ranking very near to the preceding as to vena-
tion, involucre, marginal hairs, and rather like it as to out-
line, but its frond is dark green (gathered in February, the
summer), not lobed but simple and entire or slightly waved
at the margin, and very minute, the roundish sterile fronds
2-3 mm each way, the fertile ones 5-6 111111 long (the elon-
gated terminal lobe with the involucre included) and 1‚5—3 mm
broad. The base is of varying shape, as in other species of
Didymoglossum, viz. subcordate, ovate, or lanceolate. The
apex is generally shaped into a narrow apic-al 10110, 111 which
the involucre is immersed, like some forms of Tr. sphe-
noides.

The venation is of the same type as in sphenoides, but
perhaps a little sparser. Yet, as the frond is more simple
and entire, without lobes, Ι have only found the veins all
equalg and simply bearing a single sorus, the frond has only
a branchless costa or midrib. The whole plant is likely to
be regarded as a diminished form of Tr. sfflzenoe'des, from
which it is distinguished by the following marks:

an always much smaller and almost entire frond3
