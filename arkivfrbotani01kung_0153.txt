published paper¹ forming a preliminary communication from
a detailed work on the subject, did not let it be clearly seen
that the condemnation of the theory previously mentioned
with which he now considers himself to be ready after a
comprehensive histologieal examination of certain rust pustules,
originated in, and is explained by a serious misconception of
the theory as stated by me, a misconception which can he
inferred too from some previous remarks of MARsnALL WARD.²

Under such circumstances* Ι cannot delay giving a few
explanations in order to prevent the further spreading of the
misunderstanding.

l first beg to draw attention to the fact that my theory
consists of two essential moments. In the first place Ι have
asserted, that when it is a question of explaining the origin of
soral flecks (spots or sori of uredospores) in general, we have
to take into account not only external infection from the
surroundings (Uredo- and Aecidium-pustules), hut also a
hitherto unnotieed interna] germ of disease in one form or
another, and l have based my assertion of the existence of
an internal germ of disease on such numerous observations
in the open³ and such numerous experiments in isolated glass
houses,4 that I venture to regard this existence as proved,
at least until sufficiently comprehensive proofs to the con—
trary have been produced from some other quarter.

In the next place, when attempting to explain the form
in which such an internal germ of disease could be thought
to exist, Ι have. expressed the hypothesis ss— grounded on
anatomical examinations φῆ that in the life of the fungus
there may be a period of development previous to the my-
eelium-stage when the fungus exists in a latent symbiotie
life with the protoplasm of the host, and l have proposed the
name »Myeoplasm2 for the double organism l* had thus sup-
posed. l have, however, expressly emphasized that it was
not my intention that this very intris·ate question should
by any means be considered as exhaustively solved, but that
I merely wished to maintain the hypothesis of Mycoplasm
until a better solution should be proposed. Ι have given
