LINDMAN, AMERICAN SPECIES OF TRICHOMANES SM. 21

Tr. quercifolium‚ Tr. Krcmssz'i, is by him (1). 27) said to be a
form of »Tu pusillum Suu», -— this latter described asin
Hook and Bak. Synopsis <but not pusillum Herb. Swar‘czl).
Sadebeck, in Engler und PrantL Die natiirlichen Pflanzen-
familien, I: 4, p. 105, has quite excluded ’1’·.) quercifolietmstom
the south American flora; where we should expect to find
this specieS‚ he has placed »Tin pusillum-2 (11011 Sw.!) including
two forms: »Tu quercifo-
lium Hook. et Grev.» from
Sou‘ch Africa, and »Tn pin—
natinervum Jenm.» from
South America.

I am convinced that we
have to deal here with a
widely distributed South
American fern, which is by
110 means ‘co be confounded
with Swartz⁷s Tr. pusillum
(see my fig. 20 and 21 be· ,
low!)‚ and which corresponds μ ᾆξ’
exactly with {she above men-
tioned illustrations of quer-
cifolium, montammn, and Ro-
Ιὶὶηεοηὶ. There is conse-
quently not the least doubt
that the first name qma-cz·-
folium must be restored.
The first illustration‚ in
Hook. et (irmex t.11› is

not the best and is exi- Fig. 9. 7Q1iclzonmneswwlnm rrif ιίιιιηι 11001-.
