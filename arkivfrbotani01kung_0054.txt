truncate or cordate, the blade irregularly ovate and very
slightly incised 01· crenate, and the involucres few, very often
1 (or 2). Like Tr. pusillum, this species has a partially im-
mersed or winged involucre.

The cells of a frond are pretty large, broad and open,
and partially regularly square. The walls are very thin,
scarcer 0,00:= mm, fig. 25, A, Β.

Τ1116 specieS, as 1 have understood it, is of relatively
large size in comparison with the other minute South Ame-
rican forms or species of the same series. The length of fer-
tile fionds is 6- 7 111111, but sterile and pinnatifid ones attain
a length of 8— 9 mm and about 7 mm in w idth.

lt is distinguished from To. punctatum (fig. 31) by thin,
tapering veinlets‚ which do not become ’0111611611 towards the
end, and by shorter and less numerous, deciduous hairs 011
’0116 margin.

It is distinguished from Tr. pusillum Sw. (fig. 21) by its
broader, often rounded shape and, as already stated, by less
crowded venules, which are moreover connected in distinct,
repeatedly branched bunches3 the}v also spread more from
each other and are more arcuate or flexuose, not straight,
erect and parallel. In Tr. spleenoides there are always many
veinlets, even among the lower and lateral ones, which tend
in a straight direction towards the margin, forming with this
a broad, sometimes almost a right angle. — These marks are
found again in the following specieS, ranking very near Tr.
sphenoides and forming with it a series, different from Tr.
pusillum Sw. W⁷hen viewed together under the microscope,
these two species also look different, because spleenoides (and
its allies) is much more transparent than pusillum.

There are several American species lately described, which
probably belong to this series, for instance Tr. setiferum (Bak.
1116.) 1611111611, (Third supplement, J ourn. of Bot. 1881, p. 52).
