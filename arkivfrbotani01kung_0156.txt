It was in order to explain this mode of origin that I avian-
ced my hypothesis of a mycoplasm-symbiosis‚ and the ana-
tomical researches which Ι carried out for the purpose and
upon which I based that hypothesis had clearly then 10 136
carried out with s'uch parts of plants fi portions of leaves

and stalks — where the outbreak of pustules could ¹

not be explained as a consequence of external infec-
tion by means of uredospores or aecidicspores. This exami-
11311011 1111151 136 carried out with parts of plants‚ which are
in the primary stadium of disease, a stadium which
had been described in detail as early as 18961 and has been
distinguished from the secondary stadium which can be
wholly explained by the assumption that infection is of
external origin. l have, too, whenever I have afterwards
wished 10 assert the existence of an internal germ of
disease, always accentuated the fact that it was the first
pustules of which 1 spoke, and hy no means any manifestly
or, at any rate, presumably secondary ones that were
meant.

To presuppose an internal germ of disease in a case
where infection 13)] uredo- or aecidiospores has already taken
place, an infection which gives Visihle pustules after 13111 8
to 10 days, is unreasonable, just as it is incorrect to wish
to apply my way of explaining the origin of a primary
pustule fleck 10 the origin of 3 566011(131)] 0116, 01, 11Ρο11 the

this mistake of which MARsnALL WARD now makes
himself guilty. On the basis os a histological examina-
tion of leave-flecks which had been a1·tifi‹·ially infected by
uredospores‚ he declares the mycoplasm hypothesis, i. e.‚ the
entire theory of an internal germ of disease, to be erroneous
and »untenable:>.

The mistake which has been committed is so much the
more surprising that it comes from so distinguished 311 111-
vestigator as MARsnALL WARD, and 35 I repeatedly warned
