my readers against supposing that the fungous mycelia are
identicaL independent of their origin. I have pointed out, both
in 18971 and in 1902‚2 that the difference in the periods of
incubation we meet with after infection by different spore-
forms of one and the same species of fungus impels us to
caution and makes us suspect that the nature of the myce-
lium cannot be quite the same in the different instances.
I have at the same time also urged the importance of a
more detailed examination of the mycelia which have diffe-
rent modes of origin.

I have expressed this opinion in 1902 in the following words.
»The period of incubation, varying according to the origin
of the disease, causes us to suspect that the essentia] nature
and the manner of development of the mycelium cannot a]-
ways be the same. They should, on the contrary, depend in
some measure upon the origin of rust, a circumstance to
which little or no attention at all has hitherto been paid.»

It should be seen from what has now been stated, that
the histological research which MARSHALL WARD tells
us that he has carried out by following step for step
the development of secondary pustule flecks which
have developed after infection by uredospores, quite
as little as what MARSHALL WARD formerly adduced
from his infection·experiments, including the pure
cultures, has in no degree refuted‚ or even touched
upon the theory I have advanced and which I am still
forced to maintain.

My intention with these remarks is not to undervalue
or depreciate in the least degree the value of the extensive
experiments of cultures and infections MARSHALL WARD has
previously described, or of the histological research he has
just lately carried out in order to accurately learn the ori-
gin of certain secondary pustule flecks. By the former ex-
periments he has cast new light upon a very interesting
species of grass-rust, viz„ the brown rust occuring on the
Bromes, and has thereby effectively contributed to the carry-
ing forwards to solution of the rust question as a whole.
And his new histological research shows that heis awake
