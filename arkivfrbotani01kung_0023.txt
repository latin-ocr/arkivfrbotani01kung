LINDMAN‚ AMERICAN SPECIES OF TRICHOMANES SM. 11

we find vague or imperfect descriptions3 and as they are not
illustrated at all, these species os microscopic plants must be
disregarded by subsequent authors, who can not obtain the
original specimens.

It seems necessary to give a safe and incontestable foun-
dation to the oldest species, before we can arrive at any cer-
tain knowledge of the more recent ones. Ι believe the best
method for this purpose is, to start from authentic specimens‚
01 original descriptions which are combined with an illustra-
tion, and not to spare any trouble in searching for the va-
rious forms of the polylnorphous plante, which should be
drawn all on a fixed enlarged scale together with a sketch
of the cellular structure. For my part, Ι 3111 convinced that
no words can give a fully accurate and clear idea of these
small plantS, which evidently have a tendency to change, in
various directions, a simple primitive type into very mam⁷
closely allied forms, as we are taught by the ever increasing
number of new species.

My illustrations are all drawn by the aid of the 1111010-
scope and Zeiss’s camera lucida, and then painted with In-
dian ink3 the enlargement was originally 2 or 3 times greater
than the illustrations‚ published, which are consequently as
much reduced again to ¹ 2 or ¹³'3 from the original painting.

I describe first Swartz's Tricle. muscoides. but as this
author has himself quoted Triclzomanes hymenoides Hedwig,
Filicum genera et species, 1799, tab. IV, fig. 3, and nothing
contradicts this, Ι accept lewgs‘necnoe'des as the oldest name.

By the side of several well known species, I describe
here a few new ones. The species Ι 3111 now about to deal
with, all belong to the genus (or subgenus) Didymoglossum
DESVAUX, for which the auth0r¹ has given as generical
marks: Ι

»Scri marginales exserti3 sporangia sessilia receptaculo
communi cylindraceo inserta3 involucrum urceolatum 019
hiante biligulatum.»
