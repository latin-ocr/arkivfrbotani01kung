in length3 it is cuneate at the base, and in a fully developed
state it is pinnatifid about half way down to the costa3 the
segments are relatively broad, entire or a little crenate, obtuse
at the apex, and separated from each other by a sinus ofvery vari-
able form, or sometimes imbricated. The caudex or rhizome is as
robust as in Tr. quercifolz'mn‚ fig. 7, and Tr. Kraussz'i, fig. 11.
The involucres are numerous, each placed at the emarginate
end 01“ a segment.

These observations are made on the authentic specimens
from Jamaica in Herb. Swartz (named wewam» by Swartz's
own hand). I have taken the drawings in my fig. 17 and
18 from the same specimens. ι

The best characteristics
for Tr. reptans are supplied

The cellular structure, fig. 17. 15 a little more finely re-
ticulated than in any of the species mentioned above. The
walls as to thickness are intermediate between Tr. Kraussii
and the following (pusillum, sphenoides). They are O‚004—-O‚00*7
mm thick (fig. D, E). In this species, the cells are arranged
in very distinct rows, owing to the crowded parallel veinlets.

Tr. reptans does not appear to be widely spread. Area:

(Cohrmbia, Venezuela).
