expression to this my opinion in the following manner. »l
do not deny the possibility of a day coming when micro-
technical science shall have attained to a hig-her degree of
perfectiori, and when we shall have the help of micro-chemi-
cal methods which will 110 better than those we now have
at our disposal. It will then, perhaps, be possible to reduce
what Ι have termed Mycoplasm into two organisms, differ-
ing from a morphological point of view. Until such a mo-

MARSHALL W ARD is neither the first nor the only person
who has omitted to make a clear distinction between the two
essentia] moments of my theory, recapitulated above. In a
word, nearly every writer who has expressed himself on the
question has, when unable for some reason or other to agree
with the proposed solution, also rejected the first moment
of the theory, viz. the existence of an internal germ of dis-
ease, and this has been done without any reason at all being
given. ¹

Now MARsnALL WARD accentuates in his last communi-
cation to the Royal Society that he has been- busy for a
year and a half with a comprehensive histological research,
based 011 1110 01111110011011 of improved hardening and staining
methods, and that this research has persuaded him that l
have erroneously interpreted certain microscopic preparations
upon which my opinions were based. But these histological
researehes of MARSHALL WARD have, however, been carried
out with leaves which had been infected with uredo·
spores. After 1, 2, 6 and 8 days, preparations have been
made of the infected leaf-fleeks and, parallel with these, pre-
parations of non-infected leaves have also been made. The
strict examinations afterwards carried out shewed that I had
»entirely reversed the true order of events» and that the
mycoplasm hypothesis, i. e. the whole theory of an internal
germ of disease, was »untenahlem

1 cannot but deeply deplore that MARSHALL WARD should
have drawn such erroneous conclusions from a research so
valuable in itself as 1 1110111130 11113 to be, and as this cannot
be otherwise explained than by the fact that MARsHALL WARD
