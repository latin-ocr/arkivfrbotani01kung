sible 10 be applied.¹

Ι therefore need only add a few words in order 10 make
clear 1110 differenee between this speeies and Tr. sphenoides,
which ranks very near it. The descriptions in Hook. and
Bak„ Syn. Fil„ ed. 2, p. 74, and in Flora Brasil„ fase. 23,
p. 276, are insufficient for this purpose, because these two
species are heteromorphous in the same degree, and only the
venation is 10 be depended on, if seen when magnified. Nei-
ther of these two can in every ease be called »flabellate» as

eearum, p. 379, 013100 for them both (and for >>Τ1·. pusillum»

is a strong midrib 1ο the involuere, and even in Tr. punct&

tum. Yet, in a sterile frond of both of 111050 (and 111 other
species of the sphenoides-group, for instance Tr. fontanum,

the Upper half of the costa being of the same appearance as
all 3111011301ἱ 1310131 branohes, the τ(01115 in ‘nhis 01310 may be
called »radiating as in a fan» (Hook. and Bak„ Syn. Fss„
