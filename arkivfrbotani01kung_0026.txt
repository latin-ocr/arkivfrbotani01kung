labels (such specimens have originally belonged to other her-
bariums, as Osbeck’s and Casstrom's). Ι therefore consider as
authentic ÷>museoides» (hymeneides Hedw.) a specimen, on which
Swartz has written the diagnosis published in his Flora In-
diae occidentalis and Synopsis Filicum, 180& and the greater
part of the other samples, which here in Stockholm are named
»muscoides Herb. Swarta» fully agree with this specimen.
My drawing, fig. 1, A, will show, that this species also
agrees with Hedwig⁷s Tm‘eh. lzgymenoides (1799), quoted by
Swartz, Ι may add, that Hedwig's
description is far superior to that in
Swartz's Synopsis.

When elliptical fronds are found
intermixed in a tul't, it is exceedingly
dii'ficult 10 distinguish this species
from others, as T r. Kraussie, fig. 11‚A.

pared the cellular structure of these

hymenoides is quite distinct from all

os the frond is somewhat stiffer
and brighter than usual (this is often seen in old, fertile

 

fronds, when the colour is changing to yellow), and the i'rond ,

is generally more or less undulated or crisped. This evi-
dently depends upon the cellular structure. I found the cells
very large in the VVest Indian as well as the South Ameri-
can specimens, and their walls exceedingly thick and firm,
fig. 3. A cell is often 0,1 111111 long, and the wall is Ορω-
O,012 mm thick. In Tr. Kraussiz· the walls are much thinner (see
below, fig. 11).

In T fr. laymenoides· the i'rond is generally shortly stalked
or nearly sessile, but not always, as proved by 3 i‘rond from

for instance Tr. punctatum Poir. and lineolatmn Hook.
