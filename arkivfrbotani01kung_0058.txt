the reeeptaele is exserted out 011110 involucre (bearing
bright orange capsules when I gathered it);

the marginal hairs are rather short, sparse and deoi-
‹luous3

the (andex (rhizome) is extremely slender and almost as
fine as a hair, about 0,2 111111 thiek; it is only sparsely covered
with short hairs.

The cells 01 1110 frond are fairly large for so minute a
plant; the cellular structure resembles that 01 Tr. sphenoides;

f 10. Trichomanes Mosenii 11. sp. —- Fig. 25 D, E and 27.

The Herb. Regnell in Stockholm possesses abundant
speoimens of a Didymoglossum, collected by Mosen near San-
105 and labelled by him as »nova specieSP» I have examined
this plant careffilly, and although the venation agrees With
Tr. splesenose'des, 1 believe it is a proper speeies, distinguished
from T r. sphenoides by the following marks:

the frond is generally very much extended, 01 1111001,
narrowly lanceolate, or lingulate form, or narrowly spathu-
late and in 11115 (fase slightly lobed in 0 few short, not im-
11110010 lobes3 v

1110 base is in most cases extremely narrowed or decur-
rent on the stipes the length of the whole blade;

the 51Ζο 15 considerable, the frond attaining 15 mm in
length (the stipes not included), hy 2—-8 mm in width3

the texture 15 very 111111 and transparent even in an
adult srond (by this mark it 15 01 01100 distinguished even
from Tr. pusillum Suu), and pale or brownish green (gathered
in the autumn, May, but nevertheless bearing fronds in all
stages of development),

the stipes 15 always well developed and naked, and the
caudex (or rhizome) only slightly hairy;

the involuere is small, the lips 011110 501110 size as in ’
Tr. fontanum.
