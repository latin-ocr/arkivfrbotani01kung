LINDMAN⁷ AMERIOAN SPECIES OF TRIOHOMANES SM. 9

»mu-scoides» of Hook. et Grev. t. 179 (which, as before stated,
is Trich. Hoolcerz· Presl).

STURM'S treatment of this group in Flora Brasfflensis,
fasc. 23 (1859), is very good and the descriptione correct and
adequate‚ although it must be confessed‚ that a mere descrip-
tion without trustworthy drawings can never be fully relied
on by those, who collect and study plants, so uniform as these.

VAx DEN Boscn has given in his Synopsis¹ a complete
enumeration of the Hymenophyllaceae‚ and has quoted the
preceding authors correctly, although in severa] cases he takes
the species for granted and enumerates as a species a mere
synonym, without any critical observation‚ as the »aposlum-0
Hooker et Greville‚ a synonym, which he places as a species
by the side of Tr. muscoicles Sw. It is to be regretted‚ that
the new species of this author described in a later, partly
posthumous work,2 were not illustrated, as is the case with
his magnificent work Hymenophyllaceae J avanicae.

lt is surprising that no attention was paid to all these
explanatione, When the Synopsis Filicum by Hooker and
Baker was published. The earlier conception as to Tricho-
manes (sect. Didymoglossum) is retained; in the second edi-
tion (1883) the true Tr. muscoides Sw. is represented by the
«poclum Hook. et GreV., and the muscoicles Hook. et Grev.
(non Sw.) appears by its side in a more confused manner
than before, for it seems to include also Tr. Pabstiamaem K.
Mull. and several other forms, which belong to quite diffe-
rent types3 the »pusillum Sw.» has not got its right place.
for its synonym is »quet-cifolium» Hook. et Grev„ etc.; the
arelatam» is not Swartz’s species, but confounded with Kunze's
sphenoides.

H. CHRIST in his important work »Die Farnkrauter der
Eidem, 1897, p. 26, 27, has described some of the common
species Ι am going to deal with here. As regards Trich.
nessnseoqssdes Sw, reptans Sw.‚ and pusillum Sw. in his book. it
is evident, that not one of them is quite the same species as
the original plant of Α Swartz‚ perhaps not even muscoides;
the reptans Sw. is together with ».s··)›laen0‹2'‹les Kunze» putas a
