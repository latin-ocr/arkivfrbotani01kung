to Tr. hymenoides and perhaps only a form of it).

Ι venture to maintain as a distinct species the plant,
which Fee has illustrated as stated above and called sociale,
citing specimens from Glaziou’s colleotions n. 5242.1 Ι have
seen numerous specimens of the same plant in Stockholm (Herb.
Regnell), and Ι find them very nearly allied to the prece-
ding, to which Prantl has referred this number of Glaziou’s
collections. The near relation to Tr. hymenoides is seen by
Fee⁷s description: »les lames plus larges que longues», al-
though his illustration exhibite a more elliptical frond.
