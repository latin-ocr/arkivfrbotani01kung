ΜΧΒΜΑΝ, AMERICAN SPECIES or rRicnoMANEs SM. 43

Except the two last named, all these species are unfor-
tunately too imperfectly described, and without examining
the 3311191111(Ι specimens, nobody would understand them suffl—
ciently for the identification of a specimen from another place.
Any one who reads the descriptions of species just quoted
from the Gardener's Chronicle‚ will admit. that some of those
species may be identical with Tr. sphenoides, hut unluokely
they can also be different from this. They were evidently
not examined by the author in a sufficient degree of enlarge-
ment. Even the three species, which 1 intend describing as.
new in the following pages, I do not therefore venture to
unite with any of J enman’s‚ although it is possible. that my
T rich. fontanum (fig. 26) 15 either sctiferum Jenm. or pinna-
tinem-a Jenin.. and my Tr. myrioneuron (fig. 28, 29) identical
with staticulosum J 911111.

The numerous forms of the splcenoidcs-group —— internic-
diate forms of which will perhaps 119 discovered in the futur(¹
— probably owe their origin to their peculiar habitats. These
small and primitive plants grow in old forests, which are
often of small extent, but surrounded by extensive and (11)-
districts (»ca1nposs), where the Hymenophyllaceae cannot live;
nor is it likely they can be carried away by any means from
their closed and sheltered domicile, in the moist and shady
localities in the depth of primeval forests. Some 511131191-
species are often hidden on the ground and sprinkled amongst
the tufts of 111055 011 wet stones, round a spring or a little
brook. We must admit, that they 319, 111 their natural state.
vigorous and in many cases widely-distributed dwellers of
the forest, but on the other hand they are now limited 10
comparatively small spots, isolated from each other for thou-
sands of years, and separated by wide spaces,v which thes(¹
small. and peculiar ferns are prohibited from crossing. On
account of these circumstances, we cannot wonder, that a
certain type of Trichomanes has produced various hut closely
allied species (or varie-ties, or races) in the far distant and
solita-ry localities of itsgeographical area. The 111019 primi-
tive and minute a fern is, the easier a little variation can
cause a (really or seemingly) different type (for instance the
elongation of the stipes, the increase of spurious venules7 thc
enlarged invohwre, the reduction of lobes). Ι think it 151191-
ter in this case, that we try to fully account for 3111111·
